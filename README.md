# Boyband posters 👨‍🎤🧑‍🎤👩‍🎤
<p>As one of Le Wagon's projects, we built an Airbnb clone app in just 5 days.</p>
<p>This app allows you to rent and put up for rent boyband posters.</p>

<p>We encountered many challenges: this was our first time trying to create different branches, pushing our work to GitHub on our own, making pull requests, and then deploying it on Heroku. We ran into quite a few merge conflicts, but luckily, we found out it's pretty common for developers working in teams.</p>

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
