<p>As one of Le Wagon's projects, we built an Airbnb clone app in just 5 days using Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>We encountered many challenges: this was our first time trying to create different branches, pushing our work to GitHub on our own, making pull requests, and then deploying it on Heroku.</p>

<p>We ran into quite a few merge conflicts, but luckily, we found out it's pretty common for developers working in teams.</p>

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
